# Lines that starts with # are comments and will be disregarded
#
# Each category of words should be preceded by a category title row, the category title should be unique:
# - Round things
#
# Then all words that apply should be on a single line, comma separated, and each word must be 12 characters or less (including hyphens and spaces). Avoid special characters (#+-/% etc).
#
# ball,death star,...
#
# After the challenges are done the player is rewarded with a story-line from the entity. Either it uses a specific line related to the last challenge, or a general one.
#
# Both start with:
#
# [*] This is the reward line
#
# If using a ! instead of * inside the brackets it will only be used if the player guessed 3 or 4 before solving the last challenge
#
# Story responses listed before the first category are general
#
# Note: They refer to themselves as "we"
#
# Note: If "Round things" contains "ball" if we later add a "Football" category, then "ball" must be included in that one too!
# 
# Note: The category title (e.g. Weapons, emotions) is not limited to 11 characters, and is only for clarity / logging.
